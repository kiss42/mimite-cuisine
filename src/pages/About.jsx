            MimiteCuisine began with one woman, one kitchen, and one dream â€” to share the flavors of Haiti with love and authenticity. What started as home-cooked meals for family and friends quickly turned into a passion project fueled by dedication and heritage.

              Every dish is handcrafted with heart, history, and homemade spice blends passed down through generations. Mimite pours her soul into every plate, keeping tradition alive with every bite.
